My error(s):
I misread the problem statement, the decode level k (with k between 1 and 7) needs the data up to level k and not just level k.

i.e: level 0 needs level 0 data
      level 1 needs 0+1
      hence level 3 needs 0+1+2+3
      and so on...

I would have not managed to implement this anyway (due to insufficient time available) but is something very easy to implement and is the only missing part in my implementation.
